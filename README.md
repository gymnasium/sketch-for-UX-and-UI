# Introducing Sketch for UX and UI
__Learn how to build a mobile app prototype in Bohemian Sketch__

In this course you will learn the basics of creating artwork in Bohemian Sketch, with an emphasis on building wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. We will focus specifically on how to take advantage of Sketch’s Artboard, Pages, and Styles features, in order to create a mobile app prototype. Along the way, you’ll discover useful tips and tricks such as the Make Grid feature, which speeds up the types of repetitive tasks that UX and UI designers typically face. The course will also introduce you to the Sketch plugin ecosystem, and show you how Sketch makes exporting assets fun! Finally, we’ll demonstrate how to make static wireframes and mockups from Sketch interactive, with the help of Invision, an online prototyping platform.
